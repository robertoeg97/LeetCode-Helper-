Chrome browser extension designed to assist with practicing problems on leetcode.com.
Includes a stopwatch used to help pacing when working on practice problems.
It can be viewed and interacted with through the extension popup.
The stopwatch automatically starts ticking from 0 whenever a new leetcode problem webpage is loaded.
THe popup also includes an "Ask ChatGPT" button, to ask ChatGPT for the answer to the current problem.
This button opens up a new tab with the chatGPT website, and pastes the problem statement,
prompting chatGPT to give an answer in whatever the user's currently selected programming language is.
